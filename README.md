# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Using Minimax

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures that the player can never win, resulting in either a draw or a loss for the player.

## Features
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm to guarantee the best possible move, making it impossible for the player to win.
- **Draw or Lose**: The player can only draw or lose, with the AI always making the optimal moves.
- **Simple GUI**: The game features a user-friendly interface built with Pygame, allowing easy interaction with the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

To get started, follow these steps:

```bash
